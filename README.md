  Start with Ardunio Knock code
  Read Analog pin for input from piezo sensors triggers an event
  Prints and auto analyse what you play to LCD and via serial port. 
  Outputs to midi module or computer 
  Outputs to GM wavetable
  LED note and activity sensor (one per note)
  Pedal inputs for sustain, reverb, etc and for changing voice/instrument types
  Tuning is key! This is where it gets intersting 
  The steeldrum are the only musical instrument that I can think of on which the tones are note 
  arranged in linear oder.
