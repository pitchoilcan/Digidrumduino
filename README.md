# How it works
 Modern steeldrums have a maximum range of two OCTAVES, plus or minus a few NOTES (no more than five) 24+5. A pan (a.k.a steeldrum) with 48 notes? WTF! Oh the possibilties.
 
 A multiplexer or demultiplexer enables you to expand the in-and outputs on your Arduino board.
 
#                       MIDI :   Musical Instrument Digital Interface
  EPISODE: Start with Ardunio Knock code (how to use a Piezo element to detect vibration)
  
  
  A piezo is an electronic device that generates a voltage when it's physically deformed by a vibration, sound wave, or mechanical strain. Similarly, when you put a voltage across a piezo, it vibrates and creates a tone. Piezos can be used both to play tones and to detect tones. 
  
  
  READ up to 48 Analog pins for INPUT from PIEZO SENSORS and TRIGGER an EVENT (NOTE_ON NOTE_OFF) based on a SET CONDITIONS (STICK_ON,STICK_OFF).  Each NOTE of the instrument is assiggned a (PIEZO) TOUCH SENSOR, VELOCITY is determind by how hard or softly you TOUCH the SENSOR. 
  
  WRITE/Prints and auto analyse what you play (NOTES) (INPUT) to LCD and via serial port.
  
  WRITE/OUTPUT MIDI DATA to midi-module, midi-keybord or computer
  
  WRITE/OUTPUT AUDIO to onboard GM wavetable(vs1053b) via builtin and external speakers
  
  LED NOTE and activity sensor (one per NOTE)
  
  Pedal INPUT for SUSTAIN, REVERB, etc and for changing voice/instrument types

  Tuning is key! This is where it gets interesting

#  Arrangement /Deveopment
  The steeldrum is the only musical instrument that I can think of on which the tones are not 
  arranged in linear oder. 
  TO BE CONTINUED....
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  (1 NOTE at a time, = Melody, more than 1 NOTE a time = Harmony, Time = Rhythm;)   
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
  You've heard it said that music is all numbers. Midi notes are numbered 0-126, 60 being middle C.
  likewise volume is scaled from 0-127. Frequencies in Hertz..... 
  
  Different members of the steeldrum familly use diferent tone cycles.
  
  Cycles of fifths
  
  Cyces of fourths
  
  Cycles of thirds
  
  Cycles of seconds 
    
    Dividing an octave:
  One notable characteristic Cycles or cyclics is that they end where they began.
  
#   Requirments 
  Tone library // 
  
  A sound synthesizer (usually abbreviated as "synthesizer" or "synth", also spelled "synthesiser") is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones.
