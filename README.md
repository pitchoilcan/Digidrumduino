  Start with Ardunio Knock code
  
  Read Analog pin for input from piezo sensors triggers an event
  Prints and auto analyse what you play to LCD and via serial port. 
  Outputs to midi module or computer 
  Outputs to GM wavetable
  LED note and activity sensor (one per note)
  Pedal inputs for sustain, reverb, etc and for changing voice/instrument types
  Tuning is key! This is where it gets intersting 
  The steeldrum are the only musical instrument that I can think of on which the tones are not 
  arranged in linear oder. 
  TO BE CONTINUED.....
  
  You've heard it said that music is all numbers. midi notes are numbered 0-126, 60 being middle C.
  likewise volume is scale from 0-127. Frequencies in Hertz. Differnt members of the steeldrum familly uses tone cycles
  One notable characteristic Cycles or cyclics is that they end where they began.
